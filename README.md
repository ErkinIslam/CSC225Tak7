# Learning to build a website
Welcome to my KEWL webpage

do people still write kewl anymore?

This isnâ€™t just any webpage. No, it is THE best webpage ever.

Okay, maybe not the best ever. But itâ€™s pretty darn good

My initial thoughts

I am a superstar developer Oh wait, not just yet but soon
Did I mention that I made it?
